Breadth-first search tells you if there's a shortest path from A to B.
If there is a path, breadth first search will find the shortest path
If you have a problem like "find the shortest X" try modelling your problem as a graph and use breadth first search to solve
A directed graph has arrows and the relationship follows the direction of the arrow
Undirected graphs do not have arrows and the relationship goes both ways.
Queues are FIFO
stacks are LIFO
You need to check people in the order they were added to the search list, so the search list needs to be a queue. Otherwise you wont get the shortest path.
Once you check someone make sure you dont check them again. Otherwise you might end up in an infinite loop
